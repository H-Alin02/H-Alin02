### Current Projects:
- [CodeBreakers](https://github.com/H-Alin02/CodeBreakers) - Project developed during the Software Engineering and Security course, utilizing Java programming language, design patterns, testing, and agile methodology in the development process. 

### Future Goals:
- **Deepen my knowledge in web programming**: I aim to enhance my skills in front-end and back-end development, mastering technologies such as HTLM, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and other more.

- **Advance in Machine Learning and Data Analysis**: My goal is to dive deeper into machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. I am particularly interested in supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Moreover, I aspire to gain expertise in data visualization tools and techniques, as well as big data technologies.
